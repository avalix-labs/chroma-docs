**Chroma** is an end-to-end (E2E) testing library for wallet interactions across multiple blockchain ecosystems. It enables developers to write automated tests that interact with real wallet extensions, providing a comprehensive testing solution for decentralized applications (dApps).

Initially designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, Chroma is expanding to support EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) chains.

## Features

- **Easy Extension Setup** - Download wallet extensions with a single command
- **Multi-Wallet Support** - Test with multiple wallet extensions simultaneously
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and autocomplete
- **VS Code Integration** - Works with [Playwright Test for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)

## Quick Example

```ts
import { test } from '@avalix/chroma'

test('connect wallet', async ({ page, wallets }) => {
  const polkadotJs = wallets['polkadot-js']

  await polkadotJs.importMnemonic({
    seed: 'bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk'
  })

  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000')
  await polkadotJs.authorize()
  await polkadotJs.approveTx()
})
```
