This guide covers setting up Chroma tests in GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Actions

```yaml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: Download extensions
        run: npm run test:prepare

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args="-screen 0 1280x960x24" -- npx playwright test --reporter=html

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
          retention-days: 30
```

## Caching

Speed up CI with dependency caching:

```yaml title="GitHub Actions caching"
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

- name: Cache wallet extensions
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: .chroma
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-chroma-extensions-v1
```

## Parallel Test Execution

Run tests in parallel across multiple CI jobs:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/e2e-parallel.yml"
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    steps:
      # ... setup steps ...
      
      - name: Run tests (shard ${{ matrix.shard }}/4)
        run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/4
```

## Test Reports

### HTML Report

```yaml
- name: Deploy report to GitHub Pages
  if: always()
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: playwright-report
```

## Troubleshooting CI

### Shared memory issues

Always set `--shm-size=2gb` for Docker:

```yaml
docker run --shm-size=2gb ...
```

### Missing dependencies

Use official Playwright Docker images that include all browser dependencies.

### Flaky tests

Add retries for CI:

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
})
```
