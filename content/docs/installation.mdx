## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or higher
- A package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)

## Existing Project

If your project already has Playwright installed, simply add Chroma:

```package-install
@avalix/chroma
```

If Playwright is not yet installed, initialize it first:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

Then add Chroma:

```package-install
@avalix/chroma
```

## Add Scripts

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npx playwright test",
    "test:ui": "npx playwright test --ui",
    "test:prepare": "chroma download-extensions"
  }
}
```

## Setup .gitignore

Add `.chroma` to your `.gitignore` file:

```txt title=".gitignore"
.chroma
```

## Download Wallet Extensions

Run the prepare script to download wallet extensions:

```bash
npm run test:prepare
```

This will download the supported wallet extensions to the `.chroma` directory.

## Running Tests

Run tests in headless mode:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests with UI mode (headed), use:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

UI mode opens Playwright's interactive test runner where you can see the browser, step through tests, and debug visually.
